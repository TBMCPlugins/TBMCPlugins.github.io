Much of this plugin can be grown over time, but the following must exist at the outset:


.yml files with basic skeleton structure set

empty libraries, in the form of packages (with classes as the "books" to be added later)

Global Listener, also a package, including classes for individual event listeners (these classes required now)
    each listener searches the Events library ^ for classes that use the event, then calls those classes, AND NOTHING MORE
    those classes (the books to be added later) contain the actual code to execute on-event

Logic Parser, able to search libraries for named conditions and actions listed in a Block Class, and retrieve a true or false value
    (the Block Class has been called by some code in the Events Library package, which was called by the Global Listener)
